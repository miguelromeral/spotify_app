## Introduction

ShareTheTrack is the perfect application for those who want to discover new amazing songs from their friends.  Recommend new songs to your friends and listen to their suggestions and if you like them, give them as many likes as you want.

## Availability

Currently, this App is under development. You can download the Beta version in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.miguelromeral.spotifyfriends) for free in August 2020.

This app requires Android 7.0 or higher to be downloaded and installed on your device.

##  Integration

The database is hosted in an [Google's Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) service as a documents. There are two collections stored in the servers: the suggestions (tracks shared by the users) and the user info (display name, Spotify user ID and users following inside the app).

The data is provided by the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) through the [spotify-dart](https://pub.dev/packages/spotify#-readme-tab-) package by [Max Riegler](https://github.com/rinukkusu).
